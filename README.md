Hello, world! To be honest, I almost choked yesterday. On a brownie bite no less! I cant believe that happened. I have three best friends; Alisa, Mariam, and Annika. They all go to my school, Floris Elementary. Annika is in all of my periods, and Alisa and Mariam, I play with everyday, at home or at school. Annika, Alisa and Mariam don't know each other that well though. That's all I have to say today.
